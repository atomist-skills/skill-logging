# `@atomist/skill-logging`

Simple API to log into the Skill log stream.

This implementation will fall back to `console.log` for environments in which
Google Cloud Logging is not accessible.

## Usage

To use the Skill Log create and use a `Logger` as follows:

```javascript
import { createLogger } from "@atomist/skill-logging";

const logger = createLogger({
    correlationId: "correlationId from the incoming message",
    workspaceId: "workspaceId of incoming message",
    skillId: "skill.id of incoming message",
    eventId: "eventId as passed into the skill via the Pub/Sub attributes",
});

// Send an debug message
logger.debug("My %s log message", "super");

// Close the logger instance to let it purge its internal queue
await logger.close();
```
